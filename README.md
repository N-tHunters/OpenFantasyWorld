OpenFantasyWorld is a simulation sandbox which focuses on creating fully open and as-much-as-posiible interactable world. We are trying to create a game without strict rules, where NPCs are deciding what quests to give by themselves. We are inspired by Dwarf Fortress (bay12games).

## Prebuilt binaries
Where are no prebuilt binaries for now, as the project hadn't reached its first release
